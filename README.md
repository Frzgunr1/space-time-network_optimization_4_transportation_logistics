Learning-transportation documents are are contained in the lessons. These lessons help the new users to quickly learn about the software DTALite
and walk them through different tools and processes to analyze a network.

These learning documents can be found in the lessons folder on the homepage of learning-transportation. Different lessons contained in the folder are;

Lesson 1 --> Learning Transportation Network Analysis
This lesson is divided into following three parts:

Lesson 1.1 --> Introduction with the West Jordan Network  
    
Link: https://github.com/xzhou99/learning-transportation/tree/master/Lessons/Lesson%201/Lesson%201.1

Learning Objectives:  
 
1. Understand how to view/edit network attributes in NeXTA and GIS.

2. Run a basic simulation, comparing two different scenarios.

3. Understand how basic network attributes affect traffic simulation results.
